# Overview
This Python module provides an interface to [electronic logbooks](https://midas.psi.ch/elog/). It is compatible with Python versions 3.5 and higher.

# Installation
The Elog module and only depends on the `passlib` and `requests` library used for password encryption and http(s) communication. It is packed as [anaconda package](https://anaconda.org/paulscherrerinstitute/elog) and can be installed as follows:

```bash
conda install -c paulscherrerinstitute elog
```

# Quick Start

For accessing a logbook at ```http[s]://<hostename>:<port>/[<subdir>/]<logbook>/[<msg_id>]``` a logbook handle must be retrieved.

```python
import elog

# demo logbook on local host: http://localhost:8080/demo/
logbook = elog.open('localhost', 'demo', port=8080, use_ssl=False)

# shorter version
# psi-gfa logbook:
logbook = elog.open('https://elog-gfa/SwissFEL+test/')
# equals to: elog.open('elog-gfa', 'SwissFEL test', user='uname', password='pass')  # defaults: use-ssl=True, port=443 (for ssl)
```

Once you have hold of the logbook handle one of its public methods can be used to read, create, reply to, edit or delete the message.

__Read Message__

 ``` python
 # Read message with with message ID = 23
 message, attributes, attachments = logbook.read(23)
 ```
__Create Message__

 ``` python
 # Create new message with some text, attributes (dict of attributes + kwargs) and attachments
 new_msg_id = logbook.post('This is message text', attributes=dict_of_attributes, attachments=list_of_attachments, attribute_as_param='value')
 ```

__Reply to Message__

 ```python
 # Reply to message with ID=23
 new_msg_id = logbook.post('This is a reply', msg_id=23, reply=True, attributes=dict_of_attributes, attachments=list_of_attachments, attribute_as_param='value')
 ```

__Edit Message__

 ```python
 # Edit message with ID=23. Changed message text, some attributes (dict of edited attributes + kwargs) and new attachments
 edited_msg_id = logbook.post('This is new message text', msg_id=23, attributes=dict_of_changed_attributes, attachments=list_of_new_attachments, attribute_as_param='new value')
 ```

__Delete Message (and all its replies)__

```python
 # Delete message with ID=23. All its replies will also be deleted.
 logbook.delete(23)
 ```

__ Check If Post Exists Yet __

```python
 # Check if message ID=23 exists. Returns true if it does, false if it doesn't and raises exception if logbook is unreachable.
 logbook.check_message_exists(23)
 ```


__Note:__ Due to the way elog implements delete this function is only supported on english logbooks.

# API Documentation
## Methods
### open()

```python
elog.open(hostname, logbook='', port=None, user=None, password=None, subdir='', use_ssl=True, encrypt_pwd=True))
```

Creates a new logbook handle/object.

Parameters:
- **hostname**: elog server hostname. If whole url is specified here, it will be parsed and arguments: "logbook, port, subdir, use_ssl" will be overwritten by parsed values.
- **logbook**: name of the logbook on the elog server
- **port**: elog server port (if not specified will default to '80' if ```use_ssl=False``` or '443' if ```use_ssl=True```
- **user**: user name (if authentication needed)
- **password**: password (if authentication needed). Password will be encrypted with sha256, unless ```encrypt_pwd=False``` (default: True).
- **subdir**: subdirectory of logbooks locations
- **use_ssl**: connect using ssl?
- **encrypt_pwd**: To avoid exposing password in the code, this flag can be set to ```False``` and password will then be used as it is (user needs to provide sha256 encrypted password with ```salt= ''``` and ```rounds = 5000```)

- **return**: Logbook() object.

### logbook.read()

```python
read(msg_id)
```

Read specific message from logbook.

Parameters:
- **msg_id**: ID number of message to be read from the logbook.

- **return**: Returns a tuple of *(message, attributes, attachments)* where
  - **message**: string with message body
  - **attributes**: dictionary of all attributes returned by the logbook
  - **attachments**: list of urls to attachments on the logbook server

### logbook.post()

```python
post(message, msg_id=None, reply=False, attributes=None, attachments=None, encoding='plain', **kwargs)
```

Create or edit a message in the logbook. If *msg_id* is not specified, a new message will be created. Otherwise the existing message will be edited, or a reply (if reply=True) to it will be created.

Parameters:
- **message**: string with message text
- **msg_id**: ID number of message to edit or reply. If not specified new message is created.
- **reply**: If 'True' reply to existing message is created instead of editing it
- **attributes**: Dictionary of attributes. Following attributes are used internally by the elog and will be ignored: Text, Date, Encoding, Reply to, In reply to, Locked by, Attachment
- **attachments**: list of:
  - File like objects which read() will return bytes (if file_like_object.name is not defined, default name "attachment<i>" will be used.
  - Paths to the files
 All items will be appended as attachment to the elog entry. In case of unknown attachment an exception ```LogbookInvalidAttachment``` will be raised.
- **encoding**: Defines encoding of the message. Can be: 'plain' -> plain text, 'html'->html-text, 'ELCode' --> elog formatting syntax
- **kwargs**: Anything in the kwargs will be interpreted as attribute. e.g.: `logbook.post('Test text', Author='Name')`, *"Author"* will be sent as an attribute. If named same as one of the
attributes defined in *"attributes"*, kwargs will have priority.

- **return**: *msg_id* - Id of the newly created/edited message

### logbook.delete()

__Note:__ Due to the way elog implements delete this function is only supported on english logbooks.

```python
delete(msg_id)
```

Deletes message thread (__message including all replies__) from logbook. It also deletes all attachments of deleted messages from the server.

Parameters:
- **msg_id**: message to be deleted

## Exceptions
The elog module comes with following exceptions.

```
LogbookError
    LogbookAuthenticationError
    LogbookMessageRejected
        LogbookInvalidAttachmentType
        LogbookInvalidMessageID
    LogbookServerProblem
```

### LogbookError

Parent class for logbook exception.

### LogbookAuthenticationError

Raised when there is a problem with user name or password.

### LogbookMessageRejected
Raised when manipulating/creating message was rejected by the server or there was problem composing a message.

### LogbookInvalidAttachmentType
Raised when passed attachment has invalid type, i.e. not file like object or path to the file.

### LogbookInvalidMessageID
Raised when there is no message with specified ID on the server.

### LogbookServerProblem
Raised when there are problems accessing the logbook server.
